=================================================
Revision history for POE::Component::Client::HTTP
=================================================

Changes marked with "(!!!)" may break backward compatibility.  Changes
marked with "(???)" are just information.

Note to self: Don't forget to tag the version after a new distribution
is released.  For example: `cvs tag -Rc v1_00 .'

---------------
0.38 2001.12.06
---------------

Fixed the SYNOPSIS per Jason Boxman's recommendation.

Made the Timeout parameter significant.  There was no code behind it
before now.

---------------
0.37 2001.10.15
---------------

Add a MaxSize parameter to the Component's constructor.  When used, it
can prevent the world from blowing up when someone hands you
<http://localhost:19/>.

---------------
0.36 2001.05.29
---------------

Martijn van Beers sent in a patch to have the client send an entire
query, parameters and all, and not just the path.

Some servers return bad newlines in the headers.  Detect the newline
style in the status line, and use that throughout the headers.

Added a new parameter to the 'request' event: A tag that can be used
to match requests to responses regardless of the URL.  The tag will be
passed back with a response, in offset 1 of the request packet.

Removed the requirement that an HTTP status line have a protocol type
and version.

Added the HTTP::Request to the HTTP::Response this module returns.
The CookieJar needs this, as does everyone who expects this module to
work properly.

---------------
0.35 2000.09.20
---------------

Added cookies support, and documented the CookieJar parameter for
PoCo::Client::HTTP->spawn().

---------------
0.34 2000.09.02
---------------

On crysflame's recommendation, I moved the HTTP.pm file out of
POE/Component/Client and added a PM directive to Makefile.PL.  Now
HTTP.pm gets installed.  Fixed the MANIFEST and cleaned up Makefile.PL
a little while I was in there.

---------------
0.33 2000.09.01
---------------

Initial release.  Arbitrarily versioned at 0.33 to indicate the
author's confidence in its completion (that is, it's about 1/3 of the
way).  It works for simple GET and POST requests; others may also
work, but they haven't been tested.
